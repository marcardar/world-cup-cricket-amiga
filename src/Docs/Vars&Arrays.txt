		0. The purpose of this is that when there is a run out, the
		number of completed runs is "_MAX_RUN-1". Think about it! This
		could be negative but shouldnt be! _MAX_RUN is defaulted to 0
		at the start of exh delivery. It is updated in _PLAY procedure.
		I guess it is possible that this could lead to an extra run
		being accounted for (eg if a batsman just fails to make his
		ground but goes off for another run while umpire makes decision
		- although I dont think this is possible anyway....)
		This method of finding completed runs should be good enough!
